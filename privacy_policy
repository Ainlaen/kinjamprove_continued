This extension does not save any information related to your Kinja account. Requests for Kinja tokens and authorization are only made to 
carry out functions of the Kinja comment interface, using its native API, and these tokens and authorizations are only transmitted to 
the appropriate site for the function to be completed. For example, to dismiss a comment on AV Club, your Kinja token will be transmitted 
to the AV Club site (avclub.com) to complete the request.

No information is gathered by this extension for transmission to the developer or any third party.
