This extension does not save any information related to your Kinja account. Requests for Kinja tokens and authorization are only made to 
carry out functions of the Kinja comment interface, and these tokens and authorizations are only transmitted to the appropriate site for 
the function to be completed. For example, to dismiss a comment on AV Club, a secure authorization token will be requested for your account
from Kinja.com, and then will be transmitted to the AV Club site (avclub.com) to complete the request.

No information is gathered by this extension for tranmission to the developer or any third party.
