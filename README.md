# kinjamprove_continued
A continuation of Kinjamprove, a Chrome extension to enhance the comments section of Kinja blogs such as AV Club and Gizmodo.

This project makes use of JQuery, vanilla-picker (https://vanilla-picker.js.org/), and Mutation Summary (https://github.com/rafaelw/mutation-summary).

Version 0.0.2.1 is now available via the Chrome webstore at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kinjamprove-continued/mcoeilbaljapapgpnokmhdgnmgdbimgo.

There is a bug in 0.0.2.1 when replying to the base article which prevents the editor from closing properly after hitting publish. A fixed version has been submitted to the Chrome store and should be available soon.

See https://github.com/Ainlaen/kinjamprove_continued/blob/master/version%20history for the latest changes.
