# kinjamprove_continued
A continuation of Kinjamprove, a Chrome extension to enhance the comments section of Kinja blogs such as AV Club and Gizmodo.

This project makes use of JQuery, vanilla-picker (https://vanilla-picker.js.org/), and Mutation Summary (https://github.com/rafaelw/mutation-summary).

Version 0.0.2.3 is now available via the Chrome webstore at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kinjamprove-continued/mcoeilbaljapapgpnokmhdgnmgdbimgo.

Changes to the Kinja API are preventing most features (posting comments, liking posts, following, flagging) from working properly in the current version. Version 0.0.2.4 will be submitted to fix these issues.

See https://github.com/Ainlaen/kinjamprove_continued/blob/master/version%20history for the latest changes.
