# kinjamprove_continued
A continuation of Kinjamprove, a Chrome extension to enhance the comments section of Kinja blogs such as AV Club and Gizmodo.

This project makes use of JQuery, vanilla-picker (https://vanilla-picker.js.org/), and Mutation Summary (https://github.com/rafaelw/mutation-summary).

Version 0.0.2.2 is now available via the Chrome webstore at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kinjamprove-continued/mcoeilbaljapapgpnokmhdgnmgdbimgo.

Changes to the Kinja API are preventing most features (posting comments, liking posts, following, flagging) from working properly in the current version. A new version will be submitted to fix these issues as soon as the Chrome Store finishes reviewing my previous update (10 days and counting!).

See https://github.com/Ainlaen/kinjamprove_continued/blob/master/version%20history for the latest changes.
