0.0.1.8

This version represents a major redesign for Kinjamprove. Numerous changes and improvements have been made.

New filters have been added for staff, user, followed, liked, and flagged comments. How these work is that
they show threads up to the filtered comments. The pending switch will not be honored if, for instance, your 
own replies to the thread are still pending. Replies not directly leading to the filtered comments will not 
be displayed. In addition, when using the community filter, your own comments and those made by users you've
followed will always be shown even if they are pending.

If a comment has replies which are not shown due to the selected filter or pending comments being turned off,
links will display at the bottom of the post which will allow you to expand hidden replies, one level at a time.

The scrolling footer has been replaced with buttons on the bottom left which will scroll you to the top of the
comments section or to the top of the post. This system will probably be expanded in the future to allow you
to quickly scroll to the next filtered/marked post.

Comments from the user are now marked blue, staff curated posts are purple, staff member posts are green, 
followed user posts are orange. Clicking on any post will highlight its border. This feature may be expanded
in later versions to allow saving of highlighted posts.

Additionally, the extension will now disable infinite scrolling on Kinja sites. Depending on feedback, an
option to re-enable this may be added.
